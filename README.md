# Cyberpunk 1867
Cyber Text 1867 is a text based game, made by me, using inspiration from Cyberpunk 2077
The story takes place in 1867 Japan in an alternate timeline where technology is much more advanced
(Definetly **not** done in the time period to forget guns exist)

It's not really Cyberpunk and it's not completely open world
Also, I'm still learning how to code, so don't expect everything to be optimized
Alhough, if you have any ideas, find a way to communicate them with me
I still don't know how to use github either :/

**Idea Scrapped lol
